## Notes

Learning a new language is very fun and an exciting challenge. I have always wanted to build Android applications, so this project was an amazing start. There were several features I wanted to implement that I was not able to due to timing. I spent time trying to implement a menu which would lead to additional pages but recognized my lack of time and focused my efforts on styling my app. I spent a lot of time attempting to hyperlink my LinkedIn profile to my name. After two attempts, I finally found luck with the third method. I also spent much of my time polishing up my menu bar. One of the funnest parts of this was spending a lot of time researching different methods of implementing a variety of factors. Overall, this was an amazing project and is just the start of my Android Development and Kotlin journey.
